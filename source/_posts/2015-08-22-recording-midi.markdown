This post is the week 2 assignment for the course [Introduction to Music Production](https://www.coursera.org/learn/music-production/home/welcome). You can find my introduction and assignment 1 in here: [Visualizing Sound](http://conanblog.me/blog/music/mooc/2015/08/15/visualizing-sound/).

Quote my self introduction:

> Hi, I am Conan, a programmer in New York. I taught myself DJing. After awhile I started to look into music theories and DAW (Ableton Live 9 in my case), I wish I can play my own works in parties one day. I think the course [Introduction to Music Production](https://www.coursera.org/learn/music-production/home/welcome) is a perfect starting point for music production. I am looking forward to learning from Loudon and you guys and gals. English is not my mother tongue, please bear with me..

This time my topic will be focused on _MIDI recording_. I would like to use divide and conquer strategy to explain this topic. The following sub-topics will be covered in this tutorial:

- Pre-recording preparation:
- Recording
- Basic editing

## Pre-recording preparation

### Checklist
First, let's make sure the project is setup properly. Here is a checklist:

- Proper project name and location
- Digital audio preferences
- Recording file type
- Hardware settings
- Buffer size

The following video showed how I did the checks.

### Prepare recording

As you may noticed, the default template of Ableton Live came with the 2 MIDI tracks and 2 audio tracks created. For demo purpose, I will delete all the MIDI tracks, so we can preparing the track.

In the following video I will show you how to:

- preparing the track
- adding the instrument
- config the click and countoff

## Recording

Now we are ready to record some notes. Since I am bad at playing any instrument, let me also enable _metronome_ to help me in beat:

## Basic editing

In the final part, I will demonstrate how to:

- modify notes length
- change grid setting
- quantize
- modify velocity

## Reflection

In the progress, I figured out how to config my MIDI device and DAW. And this time, I finally correctly using quantization. The process also helped me to know better the editing tool in the DAW.

Thank you for your time and feedback :)
